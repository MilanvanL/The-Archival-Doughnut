title: "The Archival Doughnut"
---

The purpose of this website is to share the Archival Doughnut as an idea to the world. We invite you to leave a comment. We hope the idea evolves in an open and collaborative way. Let's go for it.

The Archival Doughnut is a visual metaphor aimed at gaining a better understanding of the nature, scope, and impact of archival practices on historical records and to identify the important areas of source-critical and epistemological reflection in historical scholarship.

The 'Archival Doughnut' was developed on KLM Flight 1251 from Amsterdam to Helsinki (22/05/2024) by Milan van Lange. More information about the doughnut will appear here in the near future.

```{r}

# Plot the Doughnut
library(ggplot2)

# Function to generate circle points for the rings of the doughnut
circle_segment <- function(center = c(0, 0), radius = 1, start_angle = 0, end_angle = 2 * pi, npoints = 100) {
  angles <- seq(start_angle, end_angle, length.out = npoints)
  data.frame(
    x = center[1] + radius * cos(angles),
    y = center[2] + radius * sin(angles)
  )
}

# Number of segments in the doughnut
n_segments <- 5

# Generate the segments
segments <- lapply(1:n_segments, function(i) {
  start_angle <- (i - 1) * 2 * pi / n_segments
  end_angle <- i * 2 * pi / n_segments
  
  # Outer circle points for the element
  outer_circle <- circle_segment(center = c(0, 0), radius = 1, start_angle = start_angle, end_angle = end_angle, npoints = 100)
  
  # Inner circle points for the element
  inner_circle <- circle_segment(center = c(0, 0), radius = 0.5, start_angle = start_angle, end_angle = end_angle, npoints = 100)
  
  # Reverse the order of the inner circle points
  inner_circle <- inner_circle[rev(rownames(inner_circle)), ]
  
  # Combine outer and inner circle points
  rbind(outer_circle, inner_circle)
})

# Assign colors to each element of the doughnut and labels
colors <- c("#FF0000", "#FF6666", "#FF9999", "#FFCCCC", "#FFE6E6")
labels <- c("Capture", "Digitize", "Organize", "Contextualize and Structure", "Pluralize")

# Combine all segments into one data frame with a group identifier
all_segments <- do.call(rbind, lapply(1:n_segments, function(i) {
  cbind(segments[[i]], group = i)
}))

# Plot the segments
