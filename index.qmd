title: "The Archival Doughnut"
---

The purpose of this website is to share the Archival Doughnut as an idea to the world. We invite you to leave a comment. We hope the idea evolves in an open and collaborative way. Let's go!!!

The Archival Doughnut is a visual metaphor aimed at gaining a better understanding of the nature, scope, and impact of archival practices on historical records and to identify the important areas of source-critical and epistemological reflection in historical scholarship.

The 'Archival Doughnut' was developed on KLM Flight 1251 from Amsterdam to Helsinki (22/05/2024) by Milan van Lange. More information about the doughnut will appear here in the near future.
