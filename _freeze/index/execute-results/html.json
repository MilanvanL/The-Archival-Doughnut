We hope the idea evolves in an open and collaborative way. Let's go!\n\nThe Archival Doughnut is a visual metaphor aimed at gaining a better understanding of the nature, scope, and impact of archival practices on historical records and to identify the important areas of source-critical and epistemological reflection in historical scholarship.\n\nThe 'Archival Doughnut' was developed on KLM Flight 1251 from Amsterdam to Helsinki (22/05/2024) by Milan van Lange. More information about the doughnut will appear here in the near future.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
