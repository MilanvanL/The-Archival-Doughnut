We hope the idea evolves in an open and collaborative way.\nThe Archival Doughnut is a visual metaphor aimed at gaining a better understanding of the nature, scope, and impact of archival practices on historical records and to identify the important areas of source-critical and epistemological reflection in historical scholarship.\nThe ‘Archival Doughnut’ was developed on KLM Flight 1251 from Amsterdam to Helsinki (22/05/2024) by Milan van Lange. More information about the doughnut will appear here in the near future.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"
